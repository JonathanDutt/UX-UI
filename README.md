Theme:
Games, spotlight blog or review 
Ideas UI:

Progression - topbar follows while minimized when scrolling down, at each new h1 the bar will show where you are on the page. or the bar will always be active with the sections and highlighting the one that is currently seen. Maybe have something like scroll% to the next H1 show with lines in between the menu text.


Carousel - Games will be a carousel where you’ll first see one highlighted game and two games on the side (a bit faded) and then you can tap your way around all the games. 

Infinitely load content - when the user reaches Recent events you will have the option to load that content or just keep scrolling down to socials and contact information.

Own idea - the background picture will fade out and a new picture will fade in as you scroll the page.
